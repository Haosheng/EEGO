# Project Description

Our website is based on user’s plans for traveling. If a new user want to visit a place, e.g. Los Angeles, he will search for available travel plans of Los Angeles on the website to get useful information. If there is no existing perfect plan, he can customize his own travel plan and post it to the Los Angeles page, serving as a reference to future users.

In addition to the location based travel plan sharing, we can also allow group of users to create their own plans, which can only be modified by the group members. 

Some additional features are that we can make location search more friendly, which integrates google map on the page. So users can click on different areas in the map and be redirected to this area’s sub page.
